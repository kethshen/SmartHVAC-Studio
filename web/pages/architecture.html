  <h2>System Architecture</h2>

  <p>
    SmartHVAC Studio is an academic platform that integrates a web interface,
    cloud coordination, and offline HVAC simulation to support AI-assisted
    modeling and analysis of HVAC systems.

  <h3>High-Level Architecture</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Web Interface (SmartHVAC Studio)</b><br>
      Used for experiment configuration, natural language input,
      and visualization of results.</li>

    <li><b>Cloud Coordination (Firebase)</b><br>
      Stores experiment metadata and manages file-based simulation outputs.</li>

    <li><b>Simulation & Estimation Backend (Google Colab)</b><br>
      Executes EnergyPlus simulations and EKF-based parameter estimation.</li>

    <li><b>Experimental Validation</b><br>
      Uses a single-zone HVAC laboratory setup for real-world validation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Data Flow Overview</h3>

  <p>
    The web interface submits experiment requests, which are processed offline
    by the simulation backend. Results are uploaded to cloud storage and
    visualized through the web platform.

  <h3>Design Principles</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Clear separation between interface and computation</li>
    <li>Physics-based simulation with AI-assisted configuration</li>
    <li>Modular and extensible research platform</li>
    <li>Suitable for academic demonstration and evaluation</li>
  </ul>
